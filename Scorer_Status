******************** Tracking Scorer Status **************************

Able to score all tracks of an event excepting the last one.
 --> The last hit is not being accounted for. ===> RESOLVED
 
Energy deposited by each particle is not yet correct. ===> RESOLVED
 --> Is displayed as the total energy deposited in the event due to that track and the previous ones.
 
 Proton Edep is OK !
 Electron Edep = Ekin is OK !
 Photon Edep is OK !
 Heavy Ion Edep  can I assume also fEdep ????
  
Still missing the origin process information. ===> RESOLVED
Proton initial kinetic energy is not at the phantom entrance. ===> RESOLVED

problem: last electron of each event is diaplaying EKin = 150 MeV
